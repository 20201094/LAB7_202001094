Section A : 


First, I created 5 different JAVA files, namely, P1.java, P2.java, P3.java, P4.java, and P5.java. 
Each file contains the corresponding function code to be tested. 

P1.java: Contains code for performing a linear search on an array of integers to find the index of a specific integer. If not found, -1 is returned.

 P2.java: Contains code for counting the occurrences of a specific value in an array of integers.

 P3.java: Contains code for performing a binary search on a sorted array of integers to find a specific value. If not found, -1 is returned. 

P4.java: Contains code for checking if given measurements can form a scalene (2), isosceles (1), or equilateral (0) triangle. Returns invalid (3) if the given sides cannot form a triangle.

 P5.java: Contains code for checking if String s1 is a prefix of String s2 or not.
